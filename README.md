# face mask detection

This repository contains the source code and resources for building a real-time face mask detection system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with TensorFlow and OpenCV. The system is designed to detect whether individuals are wearing face masks in images or live video streams, contributing to public health and safety measures during the COVID-19 pandemic.

# Features
Real-time face mask detection from images or live video streams.
High accuracy and efficiency suitable for real-world deployment.
Easy-to-use interface for visualization and feedback.
Modular and customizable architecture for further development and integration.

# Acknowledgments
This project was inspired by the need for effective face mask detection systems during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Acknowledge any relevant libraries, datasets, or resources used in the project.
